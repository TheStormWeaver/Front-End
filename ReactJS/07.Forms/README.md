# About
- The First project is an updated version of "pet-my-pet" from "06.Workshop Single Page Application (Routing)", that has an added in type and category classification on every pet (during the creaton of a pet), that focuses on demonstrating some of the abilities of uncontrolled components.

- "react-forms" is used as a demo to test uncontrolled components, consisting of a login form that has a username, password, remember me and dynamically loads different types of services. 

- "second-react-forms" is used to test controlled components, while having the same functionality, but with an added in username clear, that triggers every time a different service is toggled and has implemented an list that shows all hobbies that are saved in the server, while focusing more on the controlled side of components.

- The final file contains the server, that is required to run for the "react-forms" and "second-react-forms" to work properly.

## To start the Projects
- You will need to enter the "server" folder, enter CMD and write "node server.js" within the directory of the server.
- After the previous step, enter the project directory of the react app and then run the command npm start in your preferred ide.
