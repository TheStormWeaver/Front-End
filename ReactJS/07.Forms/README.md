# About
-The First project is an updated version of "pet-my-pet" from "06.Workshop Single Page Application (Routing)", that has an added in type and category classification on every pet (during the creaton of a pet), that focuses on demonstrating some of the abilities of uncontrolled components.

-The second and third projects contain two different versions of the same app."react-forms" is used as a demo to test uncontrolled components, consisting of a login form that has a username, password, remember me and dynamically loads different types of services. 
"second-react-forms" is used to test controlled components, while having the same functionality, but with an added in username clear, that triggers every time a different service is toggled and has implemented an list that shows all hobbies that are saved in the server, while focusing more on the controlled side of components.

-The final file contains the server, that is required to run for the "react-forms" and "second-react-forms" to work properly.
