# About
The app focuses on testing hooks, custom hooks and context on a "demo" site. It has a basic list that displays all characters or planets from SWAPI (https://swapi.dev/api/)
There are basic implemented functionalities such as: a counter that updates its value, a list of all characters and planets in the SWAPI DB that swap between one another with a button and a list that displays all hobbies and can add in the names of characters or planets in the hobby list.
